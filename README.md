# SaveMe


Save me is an Beta device built in [Python], which connects to a nearby Wi-Fi hotspot(open) automatically. 

And helps to locate it by showing the distance between the Access Point and the User. 

It can be used to save people stuck under the debris during the time of Natural Calamities. 

We can also trigger their wifi hotspot and make our [Raspberry_pi] connected to it. 

It would provide the distance between the Hotspot and the Device [ Pi]
